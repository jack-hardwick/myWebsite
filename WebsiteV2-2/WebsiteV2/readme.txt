Lab 7 - myWebsite V.2

I've been putting together a personal website of sorts for the past few weeks and I've been struggling to find time to put into it.
I'm happy that the requirements for Lab 7 allowed me to invest a bit more time into this project! I hope you like the product of my work so far!

I'm struggling with a number of things within this project though. Namely, the Map Note spacing and the javascript for map movement. It works, but I know I could
be doing it more efficiently. If you have any reccomendations concerning how to achieve this in a better fashion, I'd greatly appreciate hearing it!


Components:

<<<<index.html>>>> main page of the site. Quick Note: While the NavBar at the top says there are two other pages, those have not been implemented in this version yet. Please disregard.
<<<<readme.html>>>> this...
<<<<main.js>>>> the main meat and bones of the JavaScript. I plan on there being seperate JS files for each subsequent page moving forward.
<<<<<loadJS.js>>>>> a module I grabbed for future intended implementation, please disregard for now.
<<<<<style.css>>>>> the main css for general purpose elements like the HTML and Body tags
<<<<<mapStyle.css>>>>> A seperate CSS file for map styling just to keep things clean.


Folders:

<<<<<Resources>>>>> Photos used in the project are stored here.
<<<<<App>>>>> Intended to be a housing for app data at some point. I don't want a messy index.html or main.js, so I'd love to just reference objects in this folder like Map Note content and Graphic geometry


Libraries and External Content:

<<<<<Bootstrap 4>>>>>
<<<<<JQuery 3.2.1>>>>>
<<<<<Popper 1.12.9>>>>>
<<<<<JavaScript for ArcGIS API 4.12>>>>>
